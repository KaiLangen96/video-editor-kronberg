# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to understand what the page is about at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see some of her work to decide if she is the right editor.
* As a user, I want to be able to access information about her prior work history.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the pricing on her work.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact her if I decide to book her.

## Design
### Color Scheme
![Colors used]()

### Typography
* 'Playfair Display' is used for the headers as it is simple to read while adding a better style
* 'Lato' is used for paragraphs and the table as it pairs well with the headers.

### Imagery

As a video editor, the main content on the page is the portfolio with her edits. 
* The [picture](assets/images/IMG_03971.jpg) for the home section was taken by Hanna Kronberg herself
* The videos in the portfolio showing off her skills as an editor
  
### Overall Feel

The main objective in creating this site was to make it easier for employeers to find and contact her as a freelancer. I wanted her work to be the most present resource on the site to succeed in my objective.

## Wireframes

All wireframes show designs for phone, iPad/tablet and desktop displays.

* **Homepage** [wireframe]()
* **Portfolio & About Me** [wireframe]()
* **Pricing & Contact** [wireframe]()
  
At the start of the project the goal was to create three pages. While working on it I instead decided to create one scrollable page instead and split the Portfolio from About me and Pricing from Contact:

* **Homepage** [wireframe]()
* **Portfolio** [wireframe]()
* **About Me** [wireframe]()
* **Pricing** [wireframe]()
* **Contact** [wireframe]()
