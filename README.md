# Video Editor Hanna Kronberg

Hanna Kronberg is a freelancing video editor based in Sweden. She has experience working for the two biggest Swedish TV broadcasters, TV4 and SVT.

You can find her new website [here](https://kailangen96.github.io/video-editor-kronberg/).

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to understand what the page is about at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see some of her work to decide if she is the right editor.
* As a user, I want to be able to access information about her prior work history.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the pricing on her work.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact her if I decide to book her.

### Color Scheme

![Colors used](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049024982694498367/1103345564919267399/image.png)

### Typography

* 'Playfair Display' is used for the headers as it is simple to read while adding a better style.
* 'Lato' is used for paragraphs and the table as it pairs well with the headers.

### Imagery

As a video editor, the main content on the page is the portfolio with her edits.

* The [picture](assets/images/IMG_03971.jpg) for the home section was taken by Hanna Kronberg herself
* The videos embedded in the portfolio section are examples of projects in which Hanna contributed
  
### Overall Feel

The main objective in creating this site was to make it easier for employers to find and contact her as a freelancer. I wanted her work to be the most present resource on the site to succeed in my objective.

## Wireframes

All wireframes show designs for phone, iPad/tablet and desktop displays.

* **Homepage** [wireframe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049024982694498367/1103298520708030464/image.png)
* **Portfolio & About Me** [wireframe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049024982694498367/1103298751436705792/image.png)
* **Pricing & Contact** [wireframe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049024982694498367/1103298853932908585/image.png)
  
At the start of the project the goal was to create three pages. While working on it I instead decided to create one scrollable page instead and split the Portfolio from About me and Pricing from Contact.

### Lighthouse

After deploying my website, I used Lighthouse as a tool to check for performance or accessibility issues.

![Lighthouse results](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1049024982694498367/1103594841767677962/image.png)

latest test ~10:10 04.05.2023

* Performance
  * Lighthouse had no suggestions to optimize the performance of my website.
* Accessibility
  * Lighthouse had no suggestions to optimize the accessibility of my website.
* Best Practices
  * Lighthouse had no suggestions to optimize the practices of my website.
* SEO
  * Lighthouse had no suggestions to optimize the SEO of my website.

### ChatGPT

It might not yet be a valid source for testing, nonetheless I copied my code into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and asked it to optimize the code once I was done. I got the following response:

> The code seems to be relatively simple and optimized already. However, here are a few suggestions to improve it: [...]
> The CSS code provided is already well-organized and structured. Here are some minor optimizations that can be done to further improve the code: [...]

The suggestions and minor optimizations that ChatGPT gave me as a response felt unnecessary and I decided to not implement them.

## Bugs & Fixes

* The videos were not able to load
  * Instead of using the YouTube links provided by Hanna, I opened the link and with a right click on the video copied the embed code directly and removed the frameborder property.
  * Instead of using Facebook videos, I asked Hanna to provide me with more YouTube links.
